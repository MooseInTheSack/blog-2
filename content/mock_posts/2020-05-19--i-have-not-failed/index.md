You know the infamous Thomas Edison quote:

>"I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." 

People like to tout this as evidence for refusing to admit defeat and constantly convince yourself you can do no wrong.

But let's be honest. He did fail a lot. He took a [long time](https://www.fi.edu/history-resources/edisons-lightbulb#:~:text=In%20the%20period%20from%201878,gets%20hot%20enough%20to%20glow.) to invent the lightbulb (or Tesla, whatever, who cares). And guess what? That's okay.

Look, I know the point of this quote is to highlight "positive thinking," and I think that's absolutely vital for one's mental health and eventual success. I just don't like how it's "taboo" to admit failure outright. During my last meeting with my boss, we talked about my "strengths" and conversely my "areas of opportunity." Just call them what they are: weaknesses. By tip-toeing around the issues by referring to them as "areas of opportunity," I feel like it tells my subconscious brain they're not necessarily problems that must be addressed immediately. They're just little tiny crumbs that I could pick up, or maybe I could just leave since they're not particularly noticeable. And I think that's bad.

### Okay Then Smartass, What's Your Idea?

Just be honest and say I'm currently sucking at certain things. That doesn't mean I suck as a person, or that I usually suck at them. Maybe I didn't have much control over many of my errors the past quarter. Maybe I was going through a divorce. Whatever the reason, I just want my superior to tell me what the problem is without patronizing me with this "areas of opportunity" crap. I can handle it.

However, I do realize everyone is different, and I could be utterly wrong. And guess what? That's fine too. Maybe I suck at coming up with ideas for giving feedback. That just means I have to learn and get better.

### The Takeaway

If you've made it this far without closing the tab and never returning to this blog ever again, I'd like to personally thank you and give a reminder of something we tend to forget: It's okay to suck at something, because you can always get better with enough brains and effort. 

I know this is painfully obvious, but we are constantly bombarded with information from our friends, family, and especially our damn phones. If you read the newspaper, check social media, text a few people, complain about your boss to your co-workers, tell your wife you're running late because a taco truck collided with a Cybertruck on the highway, and tell the nice man on the phone you don't have an extended vehicle warranty, you have received, processed, and sent more information in a day than earlier humans did for several weeks. And the more information we have to sift through, it becomes easy to forget what's valuable and what's just useless noise.

Never forget: It's okay to suck. You can improve. You just have to make a conscious effort to start sucking a little less each day, and eventually, you'll be pretty cool.
