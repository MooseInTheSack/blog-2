How did I choose this blog? [I copied someone else's](https://github.com/baobabKoodaa/blog)

I was faced with a conundrum: Create an entire new React application from scratch to use as my own personal blog, or figure out someone who's already done that and just piggy back off their success.

### Why In The Hell Would I Want To Write a Blog?

I want to become a better writer simply because I enjoy expressing my own thoughts and ideas through words. Of course, it will help me in my career and all of that, but I don't want to become a better writer for the money. I just want to be able to connect with people and make them laugh, cry, or cause them to completely change their thinking when the need arises. 

### What Would I Even Write About?

I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Southern Methodist University (no it's not associated with the church anymore) and decided to become a code monkey intern for Anderson Merchandisers shortly after. I did well enough to become a code monkey (level 3) for this tiny mom and pop shop called "Walmart" in the hustling bustling Bentonville, Arkansas. What I'm trying to say is that I am good at using other people's code to solve other people's problems. So maybe I can write about this little niche, geeky hobby called "programming." 

```javascript
import { prettyColors } from "outdated-library/pretty-colors";
if(!working) {
    work();
    //shoutout to Stackoverflow for getting me through college 
    //and keeping me employed for over two years.
}
```
I also want to write about how to stop feeling like S%#%! Life is honestly really hard, and I get that little shot of dopamine when I feel like I'm helping someone else get their little shot of dopamine. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm an addict and I get my fix by helping other people get theirs.

### Who Is Going To Read This?

Honestly I have no clue. When people meet me they probably don't think "Wow, that guy must be an organized, disciplined, intelligent writer!" I think they're more confused at how someone like me managed to weazel my way into my current position. 

I'm joking of course (mostly), because I've realized that no one has it all figured out. Accomplished people are very capable and conscientious but everyone, and I mean everyone has their limitations, and I am certainly no exception. 

I've noticed that the most powerful limitations are those which we put on ourselves. I had convinced myself for years that I was an awkward introvert with little social skills after having a rough first year in college, and I lived the next five or six years believing that. It wasn't until I started spending time with much more positive people and started reading more optimistic books that I realized how much time I've wasted believing such poisonous lies about myself.

The bottom line is that I hope I can help other people get out of self-imposed ruts in their lives and live up to their potential. I cannot tell you a thing more tragic than wasted potential, but it's so common that we eventually stop noticing it.
